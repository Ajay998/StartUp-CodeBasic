Probability Theory
Probability theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the analysis of random phenomena. It provides a framework for quantifying uncertainty and making predictions about the likelihood of various outcomes. 
Key Concepts in Probability Theory:
1. Random Variables: A variable whose values are determined by the outcomes of a random phenomenon.
2. Probability Distributions: Functions that describe the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable.
3. Expected Value: The long-term average value of a random variable, calculated as the weighted sum of all possible values.
4. Independence: A property of two events where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other.
5. Bayes' Theorem: A fundamental theorem that describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Applications of Probability Theory:
- Risk Assessment: Used in finance and insurance to evaluate the likelihood of adverse events.
- Statistical Inference: Helps in making predictions and decisions based on data analysis.
- Machine Learning: Underpins many algorithms that rely on probabilistic models to make predictions.
- Game Theory: Analyzes strategic interactions where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple agents.
- Quality Control: Used in manufacturing to monitor and improve product quality through statistical methods.
Overall, probability theory is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in various fields, from science and engineering to economics and social sciences.

Fundamental Theorems:
- Law of Large Numbers: States that as the number of trials increases, the sample mean will converge to the expected value.
- Central Limit Theorem: States that the distribution of the sum of a large number of independent random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.
- Markov's Inequality: Provides an upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to a certain value.
- Chebyshev's Inequality: Gives a bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean by more than a specified number of standard deviations.
These theorems form the backbone of probability theory and are widely used in both theoretical and applied contexts.    

Common Probability Distributions:
- Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
- Poisson Distribution: Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.
- Normal Distribution: A continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve, defined by its mean and standard deviation.
- Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.
- Uniform Distribution: A distribution where all outcomes are equally likely within a specified range.
These distributions are fundamental tools for modeling and analyzing random phenomena in various applications.

p(head) = 0.5
p(tail) = 0.5

p(queen of hearts) = 1/52
p(not queen of hearts) = 51/52
p(spade card) = 13/52 = 1/4
p(not spade card) = 39/52 = 3/4
p(queen of heart and spade card) = 0
p(queen of heart or spade card) = p(queen of heart) + p(spade card) = 1/52 + 13/52 = 14/52 = 7/26
p(roll a 3 on a fair six-sided die) = 1/6
p(roll not a 3 on a fair six-sided die) = 5/6
p(draw an ace from a standard deck of cards) = 4/52 = 1/13
p(not draw an ace from a standard deck of cards) = 48/52 = 12/13

Addition Rule of Probability is used to calculate the probability of the occurrence of at least one of two events. It states that for any two events A and B:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
p(any queen or any king) = p(queen) + p(king) - p(queen and king) = 4/52 + 4/52 - 0 = 8/52 = 2/13
p(red card or king) = p(red card) + p(king) - p(red card and king) = 26/52 + 4/52 - 2/52 = 28/52 = 7/13

The Multiplication Rule of Probability is used to calculate the probability of the occurrence of two events happening together. For independent events A and B, it states:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
p(roll a 4 and then a 5 on a fair six-sided die) = p(roll a 4) * p(roll a 5) = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36
p(draw an ace and then a king from a standard deck of cards without replacement) = p(draw an ace) * p(draw a king after drawing an ace) = 4/52 * 4/51 = 16/2652 = 4/663

Conditional Probability:
Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as P(A|B), which reads as "the probability of A given B". The formula for conditional probability is:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), provided that P(B) > 0.
Example:
In a deck of cards, what is the probability of drawing an ace given that the card drawn is a spade?
Let A be the event of drawing an ace, and B be the event of drawing a spade.
P(A and B) = P(drawing the ace of spades) = 1/52
P(B) = P(drawing a spade) = 13/52 = 1/4
Using the conditional probability formula:
P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = (1/52) / (1/4) = 1/13
Therefore, the probability of drawing an ace given that the card drawn is a spade is 1/13.

Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. It is expressed mathematically as:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B), provided that P(B) > 0.
Example:
Suppose a medical test for a disease is 99% accurate, meaning that it correctly identifies 99% of those with the disease and 99% of those without the disease. If 1% of the population has the disease, what is the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease?
Let A be the event that the person has the disease, and B be the event that the person tests positive.
P(A) = 0.01 (1% of the population has the disease)
P(B|A) = 0.99 (the test is 99% accurate for those with the disease)
P(B|not A) = 0.01 (the test is 1% inaccurate for those without the disease)
P(not A) = 0.99 (99% of the population does not have the disease)
Using the law of total probability to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.99 * 0.01) + (0.01 * 0.99) = 0.0198
Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.99 * 0.01) / 0.0198 ≈ 0.5
Therefore, the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease is approximately 50%.

In a city, the probability of a customer visiting a coffee shop in the morning is 0.7, and the probability of both visiting in the morning and ordering a breakfast item is 0.42. What is the probability that a customer will order a breakfast item, given they visit in the morning?
Answer: Using the conditional probability formula:
P(Breakfast|Morning) = P(Morning and Breakfast) / P(Morning)
P(Breakfast|Morning) = 0.42 / 0.7 = 0.6
