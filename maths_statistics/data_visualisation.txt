CONTINOUS DATA
Eg: Sale generated by movie can be number including fractions
Stock Price, Temprature, Sales Amount
  - Histogram
  - Frequency Polygon
  - Ogive
  - Box and Whisker Plot

DISCRETE DATA
Number of employees
Number of bedrooms

CATEGORICAL DATA 
- Nominal
- Ordinal

Structured data is organized, follows a clear format, and is easy to work with. (Ex: Table data, JSON, XML)
Unstructured data lacks a specific structure, is more diverse in content, and requires specialized tools and techniques for analysis. (Ex: Audio, Video, Free Form Text)
Categorical data represents categories, labels, or distinct groups. It is used to classify and categorize items or observations based on certain characteristics or attributes.
Numeric data consists of numerical values that represent measurable quantities or continuous variables
Nominal data consists of categories or labels with no inherent order or ranking.
Ordinal data, unlike nominal data, has a specific order or ranking among categories.
Continuous data encompasses an infinite range of precise values, often with decimals.
Discrete data, on the other hand, comprises distinct, countable numerical values.


Pie and Bar Chart
Use a bar chart when you have benchmark values to compare with.
Use a Horizontal bar chart when category labels are long.
Use a Horizontal bar chart instead of a pie chart when the number of categories is more than 5.
Use a vertical bar chart for time series data.

Histogram
Use a histogram when you have continuous data and want to see the distribution of that data.
Use a histogram when you want to see the frequency of data within certain ranges or intervals.
Use a histogram when you want to identify patterns, such as skewness or modality, in your data.
X-axis: Intervals or Ranges
Y-axis: Frequency
Eg: Age distribution of a population, Test scores of students, Heights of individuals, [0-10], [11-20], [21-30]

Bar Chart
Use a bar chart when you have categorical data and want to compare the frequency or count of different categories.
Use a bar chart when you want to highlight differences between categories.
X-axis: Categories
Y-axis: Frequency or Count
Eg: Number of students in different majors, Sales by product category, Population by country

Line Chart
Use a line chart when you want to show trends over time or continuous data.
Use a line chart when you want to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.
X-axis: Time or Continuous Variable
Y-axis: Value of the Variable
Eg: Stock prices over time, Temperature changes throughout the day, Sales figures over months

Scatter Plot
Use a scatter plot when you want to show the relationship between two continuous variables.
Use a scatter plot when you want to identify correlations or patterns in your data.
A scatter plot is a graph that uses a grid to present data values, typically involving two variables within a dataset
Outliers can be easily identified in a scatter plot.
Identify trends, clusters, and correlations between variables.
X-axis: One Continuous Variable
Y-axis: Another Continuous Variable
Eg: Height vs. Weight, Age vs. Income, Study time vs. Test scores

Bubble Plot
A bubble plot is a type of scatter plot that displays three dimensions of data.
Each point in a bubble plot represents a data point, with the x and y coordinates indicating two variables, and the size of the bubble representing a third variable.
Use a bubble plot when you want to visualize the relationship between three continuous variables.
X-axis: One Continuous Variable
Y-axis: Another Continuous Variable
Bubble Size: Third Continuous Variable
Eg: Sales (x-axis), Profit (y-axis), Market Share (bubble size)
