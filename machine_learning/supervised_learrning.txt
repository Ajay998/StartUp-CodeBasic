Supervised Learning
A type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is paired with the correct output.
The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on this training data.
The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

Eg: In a spam detection system, the model is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam".

Common Algorithms
Simple Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous output variables based on one or more input features.
