Machine Learning
Training a model to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. 
It involves feeding data into algorithms that can learn patterns and make inferences.

Datasets
Collections of data used to train and evaluate machine learning models.
Common types include structured data (tables), unstructured data (images, text), and time-series data.

Labelled Data
Data that has been annotated with the correct output or category.  
Eg: In a dataset of images, each image might be labeled with the object it contains (e.g., "cat", "dog").

Input and Output
Input refers to the data fed into the machine learning model, while output is the prediction or classification made by the model based on that input.

Training
The process of teaching a machine learning model to recognize patterns in data by adjusting its parameters based on the input data and the expected output.
This typically involves splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.

Spam Detection
A common application of machine learning where models are trained to classify emails as "spam" or "not spam" based on features such as keywords, sender information, and email structure.

Classification
A type of machine learning task where the goal is to assign input data into predefined categories or classes.
Output: Categorical Output: The output variable is a category or class. (e.g., "spam", "not spam")
Eg: Email spam detection, image recognition, Fraud detection.
Binary Classification: Two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).
Multiclass Classification: More than two classes (e.g., classifying types of fruits).

Regression
A type of machine learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous output variable based on input features.
Output: Continuous Output: The output variable is a real-valued number. (e.g., house prices, temperature).
Eg: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
Stock price prediction, weather forecasting, salary estimation.
