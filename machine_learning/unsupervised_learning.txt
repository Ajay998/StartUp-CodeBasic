Unsupervised Learning
A type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that the input data does not have corresponding output labels.
The model learns to identify patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without predefined categories.
The goal is to discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
Eg: In customer segmentation, the model analyzes purchasing behavior data to group customers with similar buying patterns without prior knowledge of customer categories.
